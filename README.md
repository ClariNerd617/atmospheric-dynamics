# atmospheric-dynamics

code and material I've made for use in atmospheric dynamics courses

see the python folder for python-specific code

for simple atmospheric model code, see my repository: https://github.com/mathewbarlow/simple-atmospheric-models

for calculating potential vorticity, see my repository: https://github.com/mathewbarlow/potential-vorticity
